Basic Installation
==================

1. Place your CA certificates into a directory
2. Place your CRL certificatis into a directory
3. Be sure you have run c_rehash into both ca and crl directories
4. Edit the config/authsources.php file and add:

'x509auth' => array(
	'x509auth:X509Auth',
	'capath' => 'Path to your CA certificates directory',
	'crlpath' => 'Path to your CRL certificates directory',
),
5. Configure apache in order to request the user certificate by editing your
   vhost.

   You can request a valid certificate for all the https requests (so when you
   try to authenticate the certificate will already be available). Add to your
   already configured https vhost:

   SSLVerifyClient require
   SSLCACertificatePath Path to your CA certificates directory
   SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData

   Or you can request a valid certificate only when trying to login. Add to
   your already configured https vhost:

   SSLVerifyClient none
   <Location /path_to_your_simplesamlphp/module.php/x509auth/login.php>
   SSLVerifyClient require
   SSLCACertificatePath Path to your CA certificates directory
   SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
   </Location>
