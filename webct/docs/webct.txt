  * Version: `$Id$`
  * Author: Ernesto Revilla <erny@yaco.es>, Yaco Sistemas
  * Package: simpleSAMLphp

This module provides a bridge between simpleSAMLphp and Blackboard/WebCT with
the following features:
 - Single Sign-On
 - User provisioning
 - Course (sections) enrollment (activate and deny access)

May be in future this will not be needed, as newer versions of Weblogic
already provide SAML 2 access. But until then, this module may me useful for
people to gain federated identity access to Blackboard / WebCT.
