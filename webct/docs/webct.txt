 * Download this module and place it in you simpleSAMLphp's module dir.
 * Copy config-templates/module_webct.php to the simpleSAMLphp's config dir.

More about Blackboard/Vista 8 and this module:
 - Blackboard/WebCT Vista/CE 8.0:
   - uses Oracle/BEA Weblogic Server 9.2 which has no support for SAML 2. 
     Oracle Weblogic has support for SAML 2 since version 10.3.
   - has an automatic sign-on protocol which uses Message Authn Codes
   - has integration an API, called "System Integration API" (SIAPI). This
     module uses 2 apdapters called 'IMS Adapter' and 'Standard Adapter'.
   - Single Sign-On uses 'Standard Adapter' to check the validity of a
     user id and return a global SSO user id.
 - The connector has been developed as module because it's easier 
   to deploy.

TODO:
 - update user data (name, email) when logging in
 - Single Logout
 - more docs
 - hook to display link for logging in (authn tab)
 - Asserts of config at __construct time
 - Error message if course code non-existent in LMS (ims import fails)
   refactor
 - Use SSP Exceptions, instead of Exception
 - Translate messages.
 - Allow configure 403 redirect page.
 - If course provisioning fails, e.g., some data is incorrect, SSO fails.
   Should be more solid, display an error and let user proceed.
 - The course code mapping is loaded for each user. Is it possible to
   share it? (e.g. memcached, etc.)
 - standard apdater workaround
 - Use singleton for this class?
